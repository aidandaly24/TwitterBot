# Wordle Statistics Twitter Bot

This is the second repo I've made for this bot.

Just wanted to fix things up a bit with the code and make it cleaner by initializing the repository right in VSCode.

Utilizes Twitter API to analyze data from Twitter posts on the Wordle for the day. It takes the attempts it took for these individuals and adds it to a specific spot in the data set for that attempt number. Posts to Twitter every day at noon.
